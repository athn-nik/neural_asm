STEP 1
------
FUNCTIONALITY: CREATION OF CORPUS INDEX GIVEN A CONTEXT WINDOW,
WHICH IS BASED ON THE CO-OCCURRENCE FREQUENCIES OF WORDS
perl indexing_wraper.pl 1 example_data/sample.voc example_data/sample.corpus
Input arguments:
1st: Context window size (in this example: 1).
2nd: Path to vocabulary file. Each entry determines the rows and the columns of the
     word-feature matrix (in this example: example_data/sample.voc).
3rd: Path to corpus (in this example: example_data/sample.corpus). 
Output:
The output is stored in a directory called "dsm" that is automatically created.
Two files are created.
For this example, the following files are created:
"index.ws1.freq": The corpus frequency for each entry of the vocabulary.
                  One line per vocabulary entry.
"index.ws1.index": The index in sparse format.
                   One line per vocabulary entry.
Brief explanation of the index:
The second line is: 1,86 2,5749 3,7 4,2 5,6 6,243 7,20.
Let's see the meaning of the '3,7' field:
The second word of the vocabulary (i.e., 'and'), has as contextual feature
-according to the given context window size-
the third word of vocabulary (i.e., 'money') with frequency equal to 7.

STEP 2
------
FUNCTIONALITY: CREATION OF A DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTIC MODEL
IN THE FORM OF A WORD-FEATURE MATRIX (AKA VECTOR SPACE MODEL)
USING THE INDEX CREATED IN THE PREVIOUS STEP.
THE CONTEXTUAL FEATURES ARE WEIGHTED ACCORDING TO
POSITIVE POINTWISE MUTUAL INFORMATION.
perl ppmi.pl 1 237041 7 example_data/sample.cols
Input arguments:
1st: Context window size (in this example: 1).
2nd: The number of (NOT unique) tokens included in the corpus (in this example: 237041). 
3rd: The number of entries of the vocabulary (in this example: 7).
4th: Path to file that includes the indices of the words that constitute the columns of the word-features matrix.
     These words should be included in the vocabulary. Their index is identical to the vocabulary index.
     The underlying idea here is that in the word-feature matrix you may want to have less columns than rows.
     (in this examples the rows are identical to the columns).
Output:
The output is stored in the "dsm" directory.
One file is created.
For this example, the following file is created:
"index.ws1.ppmi": One line per vocabulary entry. 
Brief explanation of the index:
The second line is: 2:3.719 3:1.040.
Let's see the meaning of the '3:1.040' field:
The second word of the vocabulary (i.e., 'and'), has as contextual feature
-according to the given context window size-
the third word of vocabulary (i.e., 'money'), while 'and' and 'money' are associated
by a posritive score of pointwise mutual information that equals to 1.040.
